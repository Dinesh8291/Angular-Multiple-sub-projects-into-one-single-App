# AngularMutliProject

This repo contains a basics implementation of multiple angular projects into one single angular project meaning you only need to ng serve one time abd that will run  all your apps.
In the app.module.ts you will notice that each sub-app is handled through lazyloading and main app views are directs listed paths. That's how i handled if you have better way please do inform.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.2.
